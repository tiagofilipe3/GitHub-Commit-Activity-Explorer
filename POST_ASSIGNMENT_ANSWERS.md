- Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

  - Choosing a chart library that covered the requirements was a huge decision. I chose Chart.js because it was easy to use and had a lot of features.
  - Choosing whether to use a component library or create from scratch. I chose to create components from scratch using styled-components, even though it took more time, if allowed me to get more flexible.
  - Designing the Github API data structure was a big decision since it'd be used throughout the app.
I chose to use Typescript to add typings to the data because it allowed me to validate it in other places.  

- How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
