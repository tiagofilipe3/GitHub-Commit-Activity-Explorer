- What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

  - Lack of clarity on the requirements

- What changes/additions would you make to the design?
    
  - Add labels to the graphic to show the weeks and the number of commits
  - Add more information about the repository.

- List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

  - Add a link to the repository
  - Add a feature to change repository color
  - Add a range filter to the graph

- Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions

    - Should I show axis labels? I assumed yes.
    - What is the repo limit? I assumed 10 is a good number.
